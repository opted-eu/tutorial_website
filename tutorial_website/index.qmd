Welcome to the tutorial section of the OPTED project. Here you can find various tutorials around text-as-data methods from political communication research. 

Especially useful for this is our growing plattform of news sources [Meteor](https://meteor.opted.eu/), which allows you to filter news sources from many European countries by meta-information such as their national scope, publication frequency or ad model. Equally, Meteor also contains software tools that make it easier for you to download and analyse data from various sources.
