Here you can find various tutorials around text-as-data methods from political communication research.\nEspecially useful for this is our growing plattform of news sources Meteor, which allows you to filter news sources from many European countries by meta-information such as their national scope, publication frequency or ad model. Equally, Meteor also contains software tools that make it easier for you to download and analyse data from various sources.\nTo learn more about our project, visit https://opted.eu."

We successfully conducted a master level seminar where students learned about comparative research, as well as the theoretical foundations of media systems. The course consisted of two parts. The first part discussed selected readings about comparative research and (hybrid) media systems. The second part put these theoretical considerations into practice by systematically comparing countries based on the landscape of available news sources. For that purpose, groups of students chose two media systems in Europe and defined the subsection of news media that they were interested in (e.g., traditional print press). Meteor allowed the students to compare the two systems based on their sample of news sources.\nYou can find all the ressources for the course we designed at https://meteor.opted.eu/guides/teaching-materials#downloads"
